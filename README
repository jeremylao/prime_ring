Prime Ring Problem:

For any even number n between 0 and 16, 0 <n <= 16, the program will print a ring of numbers such that for each number, the sum of two adjacent numbers is a prime. 

The program accepts standard input, each case is delineated by a new line, and an empty line will start the program. 

To test and print the possible permutations, this program utilizes recursive backpacking.  The key concept include: 

1) Look up table
2) A wrapper around a recursive call that will adjust and unadjust the environment before and after the recursive call

  mark number 4 as visited
  prime_ring(n-1)
  unmark number 4 as visited


Compile: 

g++ -std=c++0x -o prime prime_ring.cpp

./prime
